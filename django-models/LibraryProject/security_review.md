# Security Review

## Implemented Security Measures
1. **HTTPS Enforcement**
   - SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT ensures all traffic uses HTTPS.
   - HSTS headers enforce browsers to only connect via HTTPS.

2. **Secure Cookies**
   - SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE and CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE prevent cookies from being sent over insecure connections.

3. **Security Headers**
   - X_FRAME_OPTIONS = DENY prevents clickjacking.
   - SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF stops MIME sniffing.
   - SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER helps mitigate XSS attacks.

## Potential Areas of Improvement
- Add Content Security Policy (CSP) headers for stricter XSS control.
- Regularly update SSL/TLS certificates and server configurations.
- Perform penetration testing on production.
